##HOW TO USE

1. Upload plugin .zip file to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory and unzip
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Use the shortcode in your posts and pages to display your **button** or **MyList** (more info below)
4. You can chouse if the user have to login or not, **the plugin not request to be login by default**

###Call myList's button:

There are two ways:

1. by Shortcode
if you needs a single button in a page or post or product sheet, just write

```
[show_gd_mylist_btn]
```
in the content

2. by code into theme
if you needs to put the buttom in themes code, just write

```
<?php
$arg = array (
	'echo' => true
);
do_action('gd_mylist_btn',$arg);
?>
```
where do you want that button will show it

###Call myList's list:

you can show MyList list by shortcode, just create a page (eg: myList) and put into the content the shortcode

```
[show_gd_mylist_list]
```
to disable **share button**

```
[show_gd_mylist_list share_list='no']
```
to disable **count items**

```
[show_gd_mylist_list show_count='no']
```

###Change login permission

Change the value on row #20 of file  `wp-content/plugins/gd-mylist/gd-mylist.php` the value is `no` **by default**

```
from:
	'login_request' => 'no',
to:
	'login_request' => 'yes',
```
####note
In case the user has not logged, the user's id data will be storage in a cookie by GD-Mylist for 30 days.

So if the same user made two different wish lists, one before and one after he has logged, the MyList List will be like as new user, because for the plugin the user appears as two different users.

**For whatsapp share**: it is visible only for mobile resolution and it not works with permalink set as plain.

###Template customisation

There are different templates in html format (with php code to support multilanguage), you can find it in "template" folder `wp-content/plugins/gd-mylist/template/...`.
If you want, you can create a new one in different directory just copy **all files** and **change the path** into `gd-mylist-code.php` file variable `$template_path`.
Templates files are:

1. Add MyList button:
	* btn-add.php
	* chunck-add.php (it'll appare just after first click)

2. Remove MyList button:
	* btn-remove.php
	* chunck-remove.php (it'll appare just after first click)

3. Loading status (it'll appare just after first click)
	* chunck-loading.php

4. Add MyList button if you not login
	* btn-login.php (there is a javascript alert)

5. MyList list
	* box-list.php (where there are some items to show)
	* box-list-empty.php (when there list is empty)
	* box-list-share.php (for share button)

####Icon customization

I use **Font Awesome** as icon framework [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/ "Font Awesome"), so can change with one of that, just change class name into templets

####CSS Class

I use **Bootstrap 3** html and css syntax to create html templates [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/ "Bootstrap"), but you can change with your framework

####Values

Every templates has simple syntax to target variables, variables list in deep:

* Button Template (all are required)
	* ##itemID##
	* ##TARGET##
	* ##NONCE##
	* ##userID##
	* class="btn-gd-remove-mylist" (to remove button)
	* class="btn-gd-add-mylist" (to add button)

Minimal **button** html syntax (eg: remove button):

`<a href="javascript:void();" class="btn-gd-remove-mylist" id="mylist-##itemID##" data-postid="##itemID##" data-styletarget="##TARGET##" data-userid="##userID##" data-nonce="##NONCE##">remove My List</a>`

* List Template
	* ##postUrl##
	* ##postImage##
	* ##postTitle##
	* ##postDate##
	* ##postAuthorName##
	* ##postContent##
	* ##postBtn##
	* ##pageID##
	* ##userID##
	* class="gd-mylist-box" (required)

Minial **list** html syntax:

`<p class="gd-mylist-box"><a href="##postUrl##">##postTitle##</a> ##postBtn##</p>`
